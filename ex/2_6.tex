\sx
$\d(x^2 + x + 1) = \cdots$
\sx
$\d(7x + 2) = \cdots$
\sx
$\d(x^3+1)(5x-1)^3 = \cdots$
\sx
$\d\left( \frac{x-1}{x+1} \right) = \cdots$
\sx
$\d u^7 = \cdots$
\sx
$\d \left( \frac{u^2}{v^2} \right) = \cdots$
\sx

\sx
$\d\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1+x}} = \cdots$
\sx
$\d x = \cdots$
\sx

\ex{2.6.2}
If $y = 7x^3 + 2x + 1$ and $w = \frac1y$,
compute the differential of the composition of
$y$ with $w$.  That is, compute $\d w$ in terms
of $x$ and $\d x$.

\ex{2.6.3}
If $x = 16t^2 + 2t$ and $y = \frac1x$ and
$z = y^2 + 1$, compute $\d z$ in terms of $t$ and $\d t$.

\ex{2.6.4}
Using Leibnitz's Rule (the Product Rule), prove that
$\d_a(fg) = f(a)\d_ag + g(a)\d_af$, thereby establishing
rule \ref{2.6.iv}.

\ex{2.6.5}
Using Theorem \thref{1.8.2}, prove that
$\d_af^r = rf(a)^{r-1}\d_af$, thereby establishing
rule \ref{2.6.v}.

\ex{2.6.6}
What is the approximate change in the volume of a sphere
of radius $10$ feet resulting from a change in the radius
of $1$ inch?

\ex{2.6.7}
A metal cylinder is found by measurement to be $3$ feet in
diameter and $10$ feet long.  What will be the error in the
computed volume of the cylinder resulting from an error of
\begin{exenum}
\sx
\sxlab{2.6.7a}
$1$ inch in the diameter?
\sx
\sxlab{2.6.7b}
$0.5$ inch in the length?
\sx
both the errors in \exref{2.6.7a} and \exref{2.6.7b} combined?
\end{exenum}

\ex{2.6.8}
If $f(x) = kx$, in what sense is $f$ its own differential?
